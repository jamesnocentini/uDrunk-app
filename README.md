===========

Why not connect those ugly breatherlyzers via bluetooth to our smartphones.
Their large displays can help to track the consumption in alcohol.
This is the iOS app.

We use Bluetooth 4.0 to connect the breatherlyzer to the smartphone.
To add some social interaction we decided to build a web back-end so that users can compare their drinking capacity 
or simply let everyone know that they are safe to drive.
